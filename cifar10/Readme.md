# Description

The method used to evaluate the impact among convolution layers are an experimental approach.<br />
Scripts evaluate CNN's in an appropriate experimental design.<br />

**available scripts:**<br />
model2_p2_100.m - CNN with 2 conv layer.<br />
model3_p2_100.m - CNN with 4 conv layer.<br />
model4_p2_100.m - CNN with 6 conv layer.<br />

For models 2 and 3, the experimental table is [L16](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/tables/l16.htm). For model4, the experimental table is [L32](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/tables/l32.htm).<br />
