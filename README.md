# Impact-among-Convolution-Layers

Code for study of impact among convolution layres on convolution Neural Networks (CNN).<br />
Three diferent CNN are showed. The fisrt CNN have 2-conv layers, the next one CNN 4-conv layers, and the last with 6-conv layers CNN.<br />

The main branch has thre folders.<br />
Cifar10 - Code for Cifar-10 dataset<br />
Mnist - Code for Mnist dataset<br />
Results - Ghraphics of study using MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets.<br />
